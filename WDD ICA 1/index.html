                        With two-thirds of the planet's biodiversity and between 70% and 80% of all plant and animal species, the Philippines is one of the world's eighteen mega-biodiverse nations. With five percent of the world's plant species, the Philippines is home to a fifth of all plant species.

                        Earth's most diversified and physiologically complex marine habitat is the Coral Triangle. It includes parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Timor Leste. This vast ocean covers 5.7 million square kilometers, about the size of the lower 48 states. It comparable to Amazon rainforest diversity. Over 600 reef-building coral species (75 percent of all species known to science), 3,000 reef fish species (40 percent of coral reef species), 6 marine turtle species, and three-quarters of molluscs live there.

                    <div class="content" id="overfishtext">
                        The Philippine Sea has suffered greatly as a result of decades of damaging fishing methods like cyanide fishing, bottom trawling, and dynamite fishing. Since the 1960s, destructive fishing techniques have been widely employed in the Philippines, reaching their heights in the 1970s and 1980s when national fishing regulations naively promoted increased fish stock output without considering unintended consequences.
